cd ./__test__/e2e/27854
touch 27854.feature
```

```
Feature: ch27854 Create Paywall UX
  In order to get the most from Rex
  As a user
  When higher tier feature is not available to me I want to see a prompt

  Scenario: Authenticate
    Given I am logged in as "Rex Support Test (UK)"

  Scenario: Higher tier feature encountered
    Given I encounter a higher tier feature
    And I do not have access
    Then I should see an upgrade prompt
```

```
git add .
git commit -m 'feat(settings): init ch27854'
git push --set-upstream origin feature/ch27854/create-paywall-ux
