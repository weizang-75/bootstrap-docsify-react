## Git Rebase Interactive (Squashing Commits)

## Create a single commit 

Prior to submitting your PR we ask for all commits to be combined into a single commit to make 
merging easier.

- In your local repo
`git rebase -i`

- Use vim or nano or whatever you need to to adjust the settings. rebase does everything else. You'll need to force this push
`git push -f`
