# #1201 Add loading state to "save anyway" button in custom-validation-issue dialog

[PR #1201](https://github.com/rexlabsio/rex-app/pull/1201)

## Proposed changes
The custom validation issue dialog, rendered when a custom validation fails on a record create/update has a 'Save Anyway' button. This button did not have a loading state.

[JIRA: RADI-3709](https://rexsoftware.atlassian.net/browse/RADI-3709)

## QA

### Before
The 'Save Anyway' button had no loading state

### After

### Replication steps
1. Go to http://localhost:3000/admin/custom_validation/ and create a custom validation which simply
`throw new Error()` on update of properties
2. Go to a property and attempt to update
3. It will fail with your custom validation
4. click save anyway, and assert that you get the spinner.
