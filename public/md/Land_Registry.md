# Land Registry

## Overview

We want to provide the ability for Rex users in the UK to be able to activate an integration, allowing them to pull sales history to their properties, in bulk and individually. This feature is very similar to the existing integration in Rex Australia, where RP Data and Price Finder Integrations provide users with sales history.

Agents will have more information and knowledge on property sales history, assisting them when determining the best selling price, determining sales trends, etc.

The information sits under a tab labelled “HM Land Registry”, which is an integration tab and appears on property records under the ‘more’ tab when the land registry integration is active.
There is no HM Land Registry extension shown in the right side bar.
