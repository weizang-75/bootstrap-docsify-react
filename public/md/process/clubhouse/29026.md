__Suggest related contacts/listings when adding feedback to a calendar appointment__

### Step 1
Find clubhouse ticket id [29026](https://app.clubhouse.io/rexlabs/story/29026/suggest-related-contacts-listings-when-adding-feedback-to-a-calendar-appointment)  


### Step 2
Checkout working branch 
```
// If branch exists already
git checkout feature/ch29026/suggest-related  

// Else create new branch with the format...
git checkout -b feature/ch<ticket-id>/<branch-description>
```

### Step 3  
Prepare new branch for Work In Progress Pull Request by adding something that doesn't exist on develop. 
Here we'll create a pretend e2e test.

```
cd <rex-app>
mkdir ./__test__/e2e/29026
cd ./__test__/e2e/29026
touch 29026.feature
touch 29026.steps.js
```

### Step 4
Create the Pull Request

```
git add .
git commit -m 'feat(<scope>): description'
git push --set-upstream origin feature/ch29028/suggest-related
```
Create new Pull Request with the title  
__[WIP] Suggest related contacts/listings when adding feedback to a calendar appointment__

https://github.com/rexlabsio/rex-app/pull/new/feature/ch29028/suggest-related

### Step 5  
- Complete development, pushing commits as it makes sense to.  
- Push your final commit
- Complete the PR Template checklist

_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._

- [x] I have squashed irrelevant commits
- [x] ESLint tests pass locally with my changes
- [x] I have added necessary documentation (if appropriate)
- [x] I have rebased onto develop
- [ ] I have tested all relevant workflows locally

### Step 6
- Change the __WIP__ to __STABLE__
- Label the PR ready for review
- Announce your PR as ready for review in the slack channel and have a cuppa tea. 
You have now entered the review/qa/release vortex. Hold onto your hat.
