# #1201 Add loading state to "save anyway" button in custom-validation-issue dialog

[PR #1201](https://github.com/rexlabsio/rex-app/pull/1201)

## Proposed changes
The custom validation issue dialog, rendered when a custom validation fails on a record create/update has a 'Save Anyway' button. This button did not have a loading state.

[JIRA: RADI-3709](https://rexsoftware.atlassian.net/browse/RADI-3709)

## QA

### Context

When clicking the `Save anyway` button, the button did not disappear 
while the action was going on in the background. This PR fixes that so that 
the spinner is shown. 

Here are the QA Steps

1. Stop rex-app by hitting `ctrl+a` and switch to wings API to alpha.
```
yarn api:alpha
```

2. Pull develop
```
git checkout develop && git pull
```

3. Wait to see __UR GUD 2 GO__ in dev Terminal.

4. Go to http://localhost:3000/admin/custom_validation/ and create a custom validation which simply
throw new Error() on update of properties. Make sure your new validation is __enabled__

5. Go to a property and make a change such as the year built in Property Attributes

6. Save the changes and you should see your custom validation

7. Click `Save anyway` and verify that it seems like nothing happens

***

8. Checkout the new branch
```
git checkout fix/radi-3709/custom-validation-issue-loading-state
```

9. Repeat above steps from step __3__. Upon clicking 'Save anyway', verify that you now see the spinner while until the Dialog disappears.

10. Please __disable__ your custom validation so it doesn't pop up for everyone using alpha
