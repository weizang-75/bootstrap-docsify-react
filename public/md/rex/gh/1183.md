## Proposed changes

### r2.u.app.menu

The Advanced Settings Menu Item for Leads is defined in `public/assets/js/r2.u.app.menu.js`. There is an array which contains Objects that look a like this:  

```javascript
leads: {
    title: 'Leads',
    adminGroup: 'appSettings',
    href: '/admin/settings/leads/',
    accessRights: 'addon.leads && admin_application.access_section',
    paywallKey: true // New attribute
},
```
The array gets passed to __self.getModulesIterative__ which checks the user has correct accessRights for each module. If not, _module.locked_ gets set to true and that module is not shown in the menu. If we add an attribute called paywallKey to that Menu object;

Now we can stop the module being locked and the Menu item is now shown.

### Knockout View

The __paywallKey__ attribute is also present in the data that the knockout view `application/views/templates/admin-shell.html` uses to actually render the menu, so we create a condition in that knockout code which adds the upgrade icon to the menu link.

The condition which shows the Leads module lives in the Leads view `application/views/screens/admin/settings/leads/view.php`. If the user does not have rights to view the module, 
the paywall HTML snippet is required from the shared folder (to make it reusable).

```php
<div data-bind="ifNotRights:'addon.leads && admin_application.access_section'">
    <?php require(dirname(__FILE__)."/../../../../_shared/paywall.php"); ?>
</div>
```

### CSS

Add the sparkle graphic to the menu is done `public/assets/css/view-settings.css` bacause 
we need to show a different sparkle colour according to whether the menu item is active.

Experiments showed the simplest & most rebust way to do this is to create a fixed size div 
with our svg icon as a background.

```css
div.menu-region ul.menu li.menu-item .sparkle {
  background-image: url("/assets/images/paywall/sparkle_dark.svg");
}
```

## QA

To test this requires being able to turn features on and off for an Agency Level account. 
[Learn more](md/rex_accounts.md) about dealing with accounts in Rex world.

- ### Step 1 
    - Make sure you are using local API by using the `./support/api-switcher.js`  
```
// stop rex with ctrl+a k
yarn api:local
yarn start
```
    - Login to Rex with the root user credentials  
    email: **alex.babkov@realevo.com** password: __password__  
    selecting the account "__Brisbane Realty__" 

- ### Step 2
    - Switch **OFF** the Leads feature for the account in [Wings Admin](http://localhost:20002). 
    [Learn how](md/wings_admin.md).

- ### Step 3
    - Navigate to `Advanced -> Settings`
    - You should see a sparkle icon next to the Leads menu item.  
    ![leads sparkled](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/370513/59813967-e6ca5100-9356-11e9-9f5d-11d70ae32fd8.png)
    - The sparkle should be dark when Leads is not selected, and white when it is. 
    - Click `Leads`
    - You should see the paywall screen with relevant text  
    ![leads_example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/370513/59730902-730d4300-9287-11e9-9ba2-d00ac94f4e11.png)

- ### Step 4
    - Logout of Rex 
    - In [Wings Admin](http://localhost:20002), switch **ON** the Leads feature in [Wings Admin](http://localhost:20002).
    - Login to Rex with the root user credentials, selecting the account "__Brisbane Realty__" 


## Types of changes

- [x] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)

## Checklist

- [x] I have squashed irrelevant commits
- [x] I have added necessary documentation
- [x] I have rebased onto develop
- [x] I have tested all relevant workflows locally

## Further comments

Before QA, I need to confirm with UX Team exactly what the call to actions and 
text for the paywall screen should be. I think that will be: 

- Learn more: navigates app to a new url?
- Contact Support: opens the same Contact dialog as clicking ? -> Contact Support Team

This is the first PR of a set which will cover all paywall features. 
The intention is to raise a separate PR for each of these on top og this work. 
The other features which need to have this paywall UI implemented are; 

- Sales Trust
- Agent Ledgers
- Xero Integration
- Calendar connection
- Workflows
- Improved Custom Fields - Fields in System Tabs
- Market leads
- Campaigns
- Bring your own email provider (Sendgrid integration)
- Custom validation
