## Wings API

!> ### [API Browser](http://apibrowser.rexsoftware.com/#api=http%3A//localhost%3A20000/rex.php)

API Browser is a simple tool built on the self documenting capabilities of the API. It makes calls to the 
`Server::describe` and `ServiceName::describe` methods and presents the information in an easy to understand format.

API Browser is the older version of these API docs. While these docs are still a work in progress,
you can refer to the API Browser for the complete list of available services and methods.

API browser URL: http://apibrowser.rexsoftware.com

Please note that the API Browser only provides limited information about request arguments and the response formats.
This may make arguments appear a bit strangely at times in the API Browser.

## Credentials

Rex API uses token authentication. Tokens can be acquired by logging in as a Rex user using username or password.

Note that Rex differentiates between accounts and users (a user can potentially access multiple different accounts).

If you have not yet been given user credentials and would like to access the API, please follow one of the following processes:

* If you are not yet a Rex customer but have been dealing with the Sales team, please request the user credentials
    for the demo account from the sales person you've been dealing with.
* If you are a developer working with an existing Rex customer wanting access to
   * **demo account**, please request the user credentials for the demo account from
      <support@rexsoftware.com.au>. Please make sure you note who your client is, otherwise we won't be able to help.
   * **live account**, please request that your client setup a user for you.
